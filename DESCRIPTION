Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Chris",
           family = "Umphlett",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "christopher.umphlett@gmail.com")
Description: Applies tidy text mining to many columns of free response survey
    data. The core functionality is to facilitate an inexperienced text miner
    getting quickly into text mining from a data frame. A variety of analyses
    and visualizations are then available, taking advantage of various methods
    and packages that are available for text mining. These packages do not 
    share common syntax, and this approach allows one to quickly use them.
